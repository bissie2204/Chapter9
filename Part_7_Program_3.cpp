// Write a program that initializes a matrix called quantity that is initialized with : 
// Row 0: 2, 4,  3, 6, 9
// Row 1: 5, 8, 9, 3, 7
// Row 2: 1, 4, 3, 2, 10
// Write a function that takes the matrix, rows, columns and row number then reverse that row number in the matrix.
// For example, call the function: reverse(quantity, 3, 5, 1), so the function reverse is called 
// with the matrix quantity, number of rows = 3, number of columns = 5 and row number = 1 to
// reverse only that specific row.
