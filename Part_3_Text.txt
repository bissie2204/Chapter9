Part 3: Overloaded subprograms (15 points) (read section 9.9 in textbook)

	Define and explain the concept of function overloading.
Function overloading of subprograms occurs when one operator has multiple meanings. This usually happens when a subprogram has the same name as another subprogram in the same referencing environment. The program would encounter compile errors.


	Provide examples of overloaded functions in a programming language of your choice (in any language you want).

C++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void print(int x) {
    cout << "Int: " << x << endl;
}

void print(double x) {
    cout << "Double: " << x << endl;
}

int main() {
    print(5);      
    print(3.14);   
    return 0;
}


Another example in java:
public class Math {

    
    static int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    
    static int add(int a, int b, int c) {
        return a + b + c;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(add(2, 3));       
        System.out.println(add(1, 2, 3));    
    }
}



	Discuss the benefits and potential challenges associated with using overloaded functions.

Benefits of using overloaded functions include allowing the same function name to handle different types or numbers of inputs. Polymorphism is a benefit as well. Some challenges include ambiguity or confusion when functions are too similar, and this could lead to more errors and make it harder to maintain the code.
